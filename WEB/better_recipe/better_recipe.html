                        <h1>
                            Let's Look at What We Need
                        </h1>
                        Here's a list of everything you'll need:
                        <dl>
                            <dt>
                                About 250 grams of pasta:
                            </dt>
                            <dd>
                                This is about half of a regular-sized box of pasta. You can use spaghetti (the long, thin kind) or penne (the tube-shaped kind) or any pasta you like!
                            </dd>
                            <br>
                            <dt>
                                4 small pieces of garlic:
                            </dt>
                            <dd>
                                These little guys give the pasta a great taste. We need to chop them up into very tiny pieces.
                            </dd>
                            <br>
                            <dt>
                                About 1/4 cup of cooking oil:
                            </dt>
                            <dd>
                                This helps everything cook nicely and adds flavor.
                            </dd>
                            <br>
                            <dt>
                                About 1/4 cup of fresh parsley:
                            </dt>
                            <dd>
                                This is a green leafy thing that tastes fresh. We need to chop it up small. Pack it loosely when you measure.
                            </dd>
                            <br>
                            <dt>
                                About 2 tablespoons of fresh basil:
                            </dt>
                            <dd>
                                Another green leafy thing that smells and tastes sweet. Chop it up small too.
                            </dd>
                            <br>
                            <dt>
                                Just a pinch (less than 1/4 teaspoon) of red pepper flakes:
                            </dt>
                            <dd>
                                Only if you like a little bit of heat! If not, just skip this. It's really just a very small amount.
                            </dd>
                            <br>
                            <dt>
                                Salt and black pepper:
                            </dt>
                            <dd>
                                The basics for making everything taste just right.
                            </dd>
                            <br>
                            <dt>
                                Parmesan cheese (optional):
                            </dt>
                            <dd>
                                This is a hard cheese that you can sprinkle on top if you like cheesy pasta!
                            </dd>
                        </dl>

                            Easy Steps To Make Your Pasta
                        </h1>
                        Okay, now for the fun part – cooking! Just follow these simple steps:
                        <ol><dl>
                            <dt><li>Cook the Noodles:</li></dt>
                            <dd>Get a pot and put some water in it. Turn the stove on high and make the water boil – you'll see lots of bubbles! Put a little bit of salt in the boiling water (this makes the pasta taste better). Now, put in your 8 ounces of pasta. Cook it until it's soft enough to eat but still has a little bit of firmness in the middle. The bag the pasta came in will tell you how long this takes. Before you pour all the water out, take about 1/2 cup of the hot, starchy pasta water and put it in a cup. We'll use this later! Then, drain the rest of the water from the pasta.</dd>
                            <br>
                            <dt><li>Make the Garlic Yummy:</li></dt>
                            <dd>Put the 1/4 cup of cooking oil into a big pan on the stove. Turn the heat to low – we don't want to burn anything! Add your chopped-up garlic to the pan. Cook it for about one or two minutes. You'll smell a really nice garlic smell. Just make sure the garlic doesn't turn brown, or it will taste bitter.</dd>
                            <br>
                            <dt><li>Add the Green Stuff for Flavor:</li></dt>
                            <dd>Now, put your chopped parsley (about 1/4 cup) and chopped basil (about 2 tablespoons) into the pan with the garlic and oil. If you're using the red pepper flakes for a little spice, put them in now too (just a tiny pinch!). Stir everything around for about 30 seconds. The herbs will smell really good!</dd>
                            <br>
                            <dt><li>Mix the Noodles with the Yummy Oil:</li></dt>
                            <dd> Take your cooked pasta and put it right into the pan with the garlic and herb oil. Stir it all together really well so that all the noodles get covered in the tasty oil.</dd>
                            <br>
                            <dt><li>Make it Saucy with Pasta Water:</li></dt>
                            <dd>If your pasta looks a little dry, take that pasta water you saved and pour a little bit in (maybe one big spoonful at a time). Stir it around. The starchy water will mix with the oil and make a light, yummy sauce that coats the pasta nicely. Keep adding a little bit until it looks just right – not too dry and not too watery.</dd>
                            <br>
                            <dt><li>Add Salt and Pepper to Taste:</li></dt>
                            <dd>Now, sprinkle some salt and black pepper into the pasta. Stir it and then take a little bite to see if it tastes good. Add more salt or pepper if you think it needs it.</dd>
                            <br>
                            <dt><li>Time to Eat!</li></dt>
                            <dd>Put your delicious garlic herb pasta into bowls. If you want, sprinkle some of that Parmesan cheese on top. Eat it while it's warm and enjoy your super easy and tasty meal!</dd>
