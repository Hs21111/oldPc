        <ol style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bolder">
            <li>Cook the pasta: Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until its firm to bite. Reserve about 120 ml of the pasta cooking water before draining.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Saut√© the garlic: While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for about 1-2 minutes, until fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add herbs and pepper flakes (optional): Stir in the chopped parsley, basil, and red pepper flakes (if using) into the skillet with the garlic. Cook for another 30 seconds until the herbs are fragrant.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Combine pasta and sauce: Drain the cooked pasta and add it directly to the skillet with the garlic and herb mixture. Toss well to coat.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add pasta water: If the sauce seems too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta cooking water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it reaches your desired consistency.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Season: Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Serve: Divide the pasta between two bowls. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese, if desired, and serve immediately.</li>
